## Using the image object detection method

Read the code. It doesn't need any specific explanation.

The detected object will be marked with a green box and will be stored as an image in the location specified for output. 

All the objects detected will be stored in a data structure called detections.

You can detect up to 80 commonly found objects using the code.

For a more detailed explanation, go to the [official imageai documentation](https://imageai.readthedocs.io/en/latest/detection/).
